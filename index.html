                <h2>Cristiano Ronaldo (CR7)</h2><br>
                <p>Cristiano Ronaldo, in full Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro, 
                    (born February 5, 1985, Funchal, Madeira, Portugal), Portuguese
                     football (soccer) forward who was one of the greatest players 
                     of his generation.Ronaldo’s father, José Dinis Aveiro, was the equipment manager for the local club Andorinha.
                    (The name Ronaldo was added to Cristiano’s name in honour of his father’s favourite movie actor,
                    Ronald Reagan, who was U.S. president at the time of Cristiano’s birth.) At age 15 Ronaldo was 
                    diagnosed with a heart condition that necessitated surgery, but he was sidelined only briefly 
                    and made a full recovery. He first played for Clube Desportivo Nacional of Madeira and then 
                    transferred to Sporting Clube de Portugal (known as Sporting Lisbon), where he played for that 
                    club’s various youth teams before making his debut on Sporting’s first team in 2002. <br><br>
                    A tall player at 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 metres), Ronaldo was a formidable athlete on the pitch.
                    Originally a right-winger, he developed into a forward with a free-reined attacking style. 
                    He was able to mesmerize opponents with a sleight of foot that made sufficient space for openings
                    in opposing defenses.
